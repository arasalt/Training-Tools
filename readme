Training images require 2 type of samples:
positive samples
negative samples

positive samples contain images with required sign and negative samples contain images without required sign.
Around 300-400 positive and 500-600 negative samples are required for descent training. More the samples better is performance.

Follow the steps for training:
*Install [http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/ opencv]
*Use objectmarker program to set region of interests in each positive image and create info.txt.
This file is used to mark objects for training images.
Put positive samples in folder 'positive' all the images should be in .bmp format and file name should be like '1.bmp', '2.bmp' etc.
After running this program each images will pop up. Select region of interest using mouse (creating rectagle while left click pressed) 
use 'space' to add this data to file and 'enter' to save this data and load next file. Press 'escape' exit.
'info.txt' file will be generated which can be used to create samples for training.

*Directory Structure
Directories will look like following:

/positive
  1.bmp
  2.bmp
positive.info

/negative
  1.bmp
  2.bmp
negative.txt

positive.info will look like
  positive/1.bmp 1  140 100 45 45
  positive/2.bmp 1  100 200 50 50

*Use opencv-createsamples utility for generating positive vec file.
use following command to generate positive.vec file

''opencv-createsamples -info positive.txt -vec positive.vec -w 30 -h 30''

*Use opencv-trainincascade for training samples.
use following command to start training 

''opencv_traincascade -data <sing name> -vec positive.vec -bg negative.txt -numPos <number of positive samples> -numNeg <number of negative samples> -w 30 -h 30 -mode ALL''

It will generate .xml file which can be used to plugins mentioned above. Training process can take more than 5-6 hour depending on processesing power of the system.
